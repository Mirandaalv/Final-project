            <h2>Jenna Ortega</h2>
            <p>Jenna Oretag is one of my favorite actors. She has started in many different movies and tv shows. The first ever movie she stared in was Iron Man 3. Where she played the role of the presidents daughter whom was missing a leg. Her latest movie was a sequal to the 1988 film Beetlejuice. This movie was called Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, where she played the role of Lydia Deetz teenage daughter, Astrid Deetz. She became most popular for her role in the Nexflix original series, Wednesday. However, my favorite role that she has played has to be Tara Carpenter in Scream 5 and 6. </p>
